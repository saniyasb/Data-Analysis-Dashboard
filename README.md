# Regional Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel + VBA)
# Project Objective
### The creation of a dynamic Excel dashboard that monitors sales performance across several regions is the aim of this project. Key performance indicators like total sales, target hit percentage, and target deviations are the main focus. Slicers are used on the dashboard to filter data by city, and pivot charts are used to display insights. The dashboard is made interactive and effective by using VBA macros to automate slicer-to-pivot table connections based on cell values. Bar, pie, and line charts are examples of visual elements that facilitate rapid trend understanding. With the least amount of manual labor, this tool is intended to help managers and sales teams make data-driven decisions.
