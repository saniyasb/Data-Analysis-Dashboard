# Regional Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel + VBA)
# Project Objective
### The creation of a dynamic Excel dashboard that monitors sales performance across several regions is the aim of this project. Key performance indicators like total sales, target hit percentage, and target deviations are the main focus. Slicers are used on the dashboard to filter data by city, and pivot charts are used to display insights. The dashboard is made interactive and effective by using VBA macros to automate slicer-to-pivot table connections based on cell values. Bar, pie, and line charts are examples of visual elements that facilitate rapid trend understanding. With the least amount of manual labor, this tool is intended to help managers and sales teams make data-driven decisions.
## Dataset Used
<a href ="https://github.com/saniyasb/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/final%20excel%20project%201%20(1).xlsx">Dataset</a>
## Questions (KPIs)
- Which city recorded the highest total sales?
- Who are the top 5 performing sales executives?
- What is the Target Hit % by each region?
- Which sales executives are farthest from reaching their targets?
- What is the average sales made per day per region?
- How does each region compare using bar, pie, and line charts?
- What is the total sales achieved versus the overall target?
- Which city has the most consistent daily sales performance?
- Whatâ€™s the overall percentage of target achieved across all cities?
- How effectively are slicers and dashboards reflecting regional data?

- Dashboard interaction <a href="https://github.com/saniyasb/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Screenshot%202025-07-29%20002946.png">View Dashboard</a>
## Process
- Gathered and arranged daily sales information by executive and region.
- Target Hit percentage, Deviation, and Total Sales were calculated KPIs.
- For insights, I made pivot tables and bar, pie, and line charts.
- Slicers were used for dynamic views and region-wise filtering.
- Slicer-pivot connections were automated with VBA macros.

## Project Insights
- By connecting slicers to pivot tables according to cell values, VBA macros allow for dynamic interactivity.
- Team performance across several cities can be quickly compared thanks to region-wise analysis.
- Top and underperforming executives can be identified with the use of KPI visuals such as Target Hit % and Deviation.
- Decision-makers can quickly and easily gain insights from charts (bar, pie, and line).
- The dashboard increases sales tracking efficiency and decreases manual labor.

## Conclusion
This sales dashboard, which is based on Excel, offers an automated and interactive way to monitor regional performance. It makes decision-making easier for teams and managers by integrating VBA macros, slicers, KPI metrics, and pivot tables. The project is a useful tool for any sales-driven organization since it improves data visibility, minimizes manual labor, and offers distinct insights into sales trends and targets.
